# Introspection
There is a general pattern in the way I approach new things.
1. Learn the basics
2. Get comfortable beyond initial hiccups
3. Leave it for couple of weeks and forget about it
4. See some article, podcast or video about that thing and get excited again

From here either of the following 2 possibilities happens
- Get back to the thing and get better at it. (Very rare)
- Meh, boring. Jump to some new thing. (Mostly this)

As a result I'm stuck in this cycle of mediocrity trap and turned into **Master of None**.

# Way out
Here I'll try to share the things I am learning (stage 2) or learnt earlier (stage 4).

It will help me by solidifying my learning as well as giving a medium to refer back to earlier mental space. Moreover it may give a perspective to other fellow beginners out there.

Hope to see you soon :)
